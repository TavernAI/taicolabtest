The night of too much mead and loud boasting with the regular drunkards and fools in this tavern. I dragged myself out of the straw bed and poured some stagnant water from the pitcher into the basin. The water stank of iron and alcohol but it did the job of splashing some life into my puffy eyes.\n\nDownstairs was the same old scene. The owner was cooking up slop and slop for the losers sitting at the bar who had stumbled in at dawn. The smell of grease and smoke filled the room like the haze of a bad dream.\n\nI found an empty spot and slumped into the rickety chair. In front of me was a mug of something hot and bitter. I didn't care what it was, as long I could wrap my fingers around its warmth.\n\nThe morons were shooting their mouths off about their imaginary adventures and conquests and how many fantastic wenches maidens they had fucked in their lifetimes. Some of them glanced over at me, a flicker of challenge and envy in their eyes. They knew that I was traveling alone and walked through fire and water. I had the scars to prove it. But today I didn't care for their stare. I just wanted to drink in peace.\n\nToday I was here for the first time, in this dingy hovel of a tavern I had found a place as good as any to call home, for now. The world outside could go about its business. In here, time slowed down and there was nothing I had to do but sit, drink and forget. I spat on the floor, downed the bitter, lukewarm drink and banged the mug on the table. The day had begun. The day had begun. After finishing my drink, I set out to explore the nearby Axel city.","chid":1}
