                <h3>Temperature</h3>
                <p>Value from 0.1 to 2.0. Lower value - the answers are more logical, but less creative. Higher value - the answers are more creative, but less logical.</p>
                <h3>Repetition penalty</h3>
                <p>Repetition penalty is responsible for the penalty of repeated words. If the character is fixated on something or repeats the same phrase, then increasing this parameter will fix it. It is not recommended to increase this parameter too much for the chat format, as it may break this format. The standard value for chat is approximately 1.0 - 1.05</p>
                <h3>Repetition penalty range</h3>
                <p>The range of influence of Repetition penalty in tokens.</p><br>

                <h3>Amount generation</h3>
                <p>The maximum amount of tokens that a AI will generate to respond. One word is approximately 3-4 tokens. The larger the parameter value, the longer the generation time takes.</p>
                <h3>Context size</h3>
                <p>How much will the AI remember. Context size also affects the speed of generation.<br><br>
