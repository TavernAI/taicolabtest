                <h3>Free Character Name Mode</h3>
                <p>The mode in which the TaverAI worked at the very beginning. The difference from the standard mode is that the character's name is not automatically inserted into the promt and the model has more freedom to generate. This is useful for narrative models, such as Nerys and Erebus, because in this mode they can generate a narrative that is not the answer of the AI character. And thus make the answers more descriptive.</p>

                <p>In this mode, you can continue the message from the AI if it was cut off in the middle.</p>

                <p>Also, if at the first dispatch, the ai generated a response instead of the user, then in this case the request is forwarded already in the classical mode, with the addition of the bot name.</P>
