                <h2>First message</h2>
                <p>An important thing that sets exactly how and in what style the character will communicate. 
                    It is desirable that the character's first message be long, so that later it would be less 
                    likely that the character would respond in monosyllables. You can also use asterisks ** to describe the character's actions. For example:<br><br>
                    <i>*I noticed you came inside, I walked up and stood right in front of you* Wellcome. I'm glad to see you here. *i said with toothy smug sunny smile looking you straight in the eye* What brings you...</i> etc
                </p>
                <h3>Updates</h3>
                <p>
                    Later, the ability to specify several examples of answer messages will be added so that a more 
                    detailed image of the character personality can be recreated.
