                <h2>Character description</h2>
                <p>Used to add the character description and the rest that the AI should 
                    know. For example, you can add information about the world in which the action takes place and describe 
                    the characteristics for the character you are playing for. Usually it all takes 200-350 tokens.</p>
                <h3>Methods and format</h3>
                <p>For most Kobold's models the easiest way is to use a free form for description, and in each sentence it is desirable to specify the name of the character. 
                    The entire description should be in one line without hyphenation. For examle:<br><br>
                    <i>Chloe is a female elf. Chloe wears black-white maid dress with green collar and red glasses. Chloe has medium length black hair. 
                        Chloe's personality is...</i> etc.</p>
                
                <p>But that the AI would be less confused the best way is to use the W++ format. Details here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client/wiki/Pro-Tips">Pro-Tips</a></p>
