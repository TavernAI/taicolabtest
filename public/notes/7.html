If the character is fixated on something or repeats the same phrase, then increasing this parameter will fix it. It is not recommended to increase this parameter too much for the chat format, as it may break this format. The standard value for chat is approximately 1.0 - 1.05</p>
                <h3>Repetition penalty range</h3>
                <p>The range of influence of Repetition penalty in tokens.</p>
